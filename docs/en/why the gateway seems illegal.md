It's simple: **I think** it violates Discord's TOS.

As described in [this article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-),
> **Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found.**
 
However, Gateway is fully described [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway), and is used by both bots and users.

Strange.

If you are ready, it's time to go to [Gateway setup](./gateway/configure.md).
