## System requirements
- Windows 10+ (cuz flutter requires it)
- Linux and MacOS builds in the future
- That's all

## Issues
Please leave your issues on [this page][issues]. It is very important because:
- I don't know how to **code** ~~flutter apps~~
- I understand only about **7**% of my code
- The rest **93**% of my code is crap
- I don't know how to **test** flutter apps

Thanks!
