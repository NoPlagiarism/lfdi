# Introduction

You don't use Spotify ~~(that's fine)~~, but you want to show your music
in your Discord status? LFDI can help you do that!

## Why LFDI?

- **Looks really cool**
- Funny **app name**
- Written in [Flutter][flutter] *(this is very important!)*
- You can minimize the app to the system tray (no analogue can do that)
- Written by [tŒ±ngenx][tangenx]                             <- it's me!
- Works (no analogue can do that)
- Uses a maximum of **80** MB of your RAM!

[tangenx]: https://github.com/tangenx

## Quick Overview

LFDI updates your [Discord][Discord] status every 30 seconds,
showing what you are listening to.

You can customize your status! For example, you can **playing some music**
or **listening to <your_application_music>**.

  ![Status example 2](https://i.imgur.com/cfA9HfG.png)

</div>

As you can see, LFDI counts the number of times you've listened to the track and
how much time you've spent listening to it!

<details>
  <summary>You can minimize the application to the system tray and continue
  to do your business with your favorite music!</summary>

And you can also set the startup instead of with the system startup,
and forget about the app altogether ~~(don't, please)~~!

[Discord]: https://discord.com/

## Installation

- Open the [latest release page][Latest release]
- Download the installer depending on your system
~~(please remember to make the release for MacOS)~~
- Run the installer and follow the instructions

[Latest release]: https://github.com/tangenx/lfdi/releases/latest

## Initial settings

The app needs your [last.fm API key][last.fm API key] and username.

On the `Last.fm settings` page, enter Last.fm API key and username in the
corresponding fields. Then click **Apply** and magic happens!

<div align='center'>

</div>

You now have **playing** statuses available to you.
To use **listening to** statuses, go to the `Discord Gateway settings` page.

**WARNING:** Using "listening" statuses [seems illegal](./docs/en/why%20the%20gateway%20seems%20illegal.md)!

To set up the Discord Gateway, [click here](./docs/en/gateway/configure.md).

[last.fm API key]: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create

## System requirements

- Windows 7 or newer (Amazing, it works on Windows 7!)
- Linux and MacOS builds in the future
- That's all

## Issues

Please leave your issues on [this page][issues]. It is very important because:

- I don't know how to **code** ~~flutter apps~~
- I understand only about **7**% of my code
- The rest **93**% of my code is crap
- I don't know how to **test** flutter apps

Thanks!
